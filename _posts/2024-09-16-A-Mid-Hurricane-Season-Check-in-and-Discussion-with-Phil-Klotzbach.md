Earlier in the summer, Colorado State University and other agencies that give seasonal outlooks for tropical cyclone activity predicted a very active Atlantic hurricane season. But it's mid-season now and the Atlantic basin is pretty quiet. What's going on? We sat down with [Phil Klotzbach](https://newsmediarelations.colostate.edu/contacts/phil-klotzbach/), senior research scientist at Colorado State and expert in seasonal hurricane forecasting for the Atlantic basin, to discuss the lull in activity. Full video of interview and a summarized version of the transcript — with links + additional context in brackets — provided below.
