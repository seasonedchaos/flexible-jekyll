The North Atlantic Oscillation is a [Scottish punk rock band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Oscillation_(band)) that has found commercial success. At least more success than our punk-yodeling band, the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (OK, that one isn’t real). The Scottish band is named after the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), an atmospheric climate pattern -- the spotlight of this blog.

<h2>Opening Act: Air Pressure</h2>

        	We’ve mentioned air pressure a lot in this blog but we haven’t really defined it. Pressure is just the concentration of air over a certain area and is usually measured in millibars (mb), also known as hectopascals (hPa). Air tends to flow from high pressure to low pressure. However, due to the rotation of the Earth (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6L5UD240mCQ), air is deflected to the right and spirals counterclockwise around the low pressure center in the northern hemisphere. High pressure systems work in the opposite way-- air moves clockwise and outward. See if you can find some pressure systems here: https://earth.nullschool.net/ . Ultimately, air pressure determines the movement and path of storms.

Main Show: The North Atlantic Oscillation 

        	The NAO is primarily an atmospheric oscillation and is identified by pressure. The positive phase of the NAO is associated with very high surface pressure over the Atlantic Ocean between Bermuda and Spain and very low pressure over Greenland. This causes more storms to move over northern Europe and the U.S east coast. During the negative phase of the NAO there is still high pressure over the Atlantic and low pressure over Greenland but they are much weaker (near average) and the high pressure area is located much closer to Europe. This causes more storms to track over southern Europe and leaves northern Europe and the Eastern U.S. relatively dry. Clearly the NAO is very important for predicting rainfall in the US and Europe, not to mention the other impacts it has on hurricane tracks and tides.

Featuring: Jet Stream

	The NAO impacts U.S. and European weather by funking with the jet stream (link?). Each hemisphere has two jets: a subtropical jet and a subpolar jet. We will focus only on the subpolar jet as it is most affected by the NAO and it is more important to U.S. and European weather. The jet stream is a fast-moving “tube” of air flowing around the globe from west to east. The strongest winds are generally in the mid-level of the troposphere flowing around 110mph. The jet stream separates the warm tropical air to the south from the cold polar air to the north. A positive NAO phase generally means a straighter jet stream. The polar air stays north of the jet and the warm air stays to the south of the jet, and everything seems normal (but we know nothing is ever really normal in the atmosphere). So, then a negative NAO phase must mean madness! Not necessarily, but it does mean waviness. Meanders, or waves, in the jet stream cause dry, cool polar air to dip south and warm, moist air from the tropics to reach farther north. These waves of the jet stream can be responsible for the crazy cold or warm temperatures that often seem unseasonable or out of place, such as snow in Alabama or a heat wave in Minnesota.

Encore: Predictability of NAO

If you live on the east coast of the U.S. or Canada or within Europe, the fate of your winter is often in NAO’s hands. Forecasters really depend on knowing the NAO phase to make long-range outlooks on temperature and precipitation in the cold season (cold season = October through April). 

It can be difficult to predict NAO phases since it both fluctuates a lot within a single season (intraseasonal variability) and fluctuates a lot from year to year (interannual variability). Some phases last months, while others last just days. What this means is that over the past twenty years the NAO may be mostly in a positive phase however this year the NAO may be mostly negative but in a single day the NAO could still be positive. Sometimes, the NAO is neutral, so we can’t use it to understand temperature and precipitation patterns. But overall, forecasters (link to CPC- https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/pna/nao.shtml)are not so bad at predicting the NAO phases in the winter, so from a forecasting perspective it can be good news when the NAO is headlining. 





What exactly constitutes a weather event? You may have heard of a front coming from the west that will bring severe weather or huge amounts of snow in the next few days. But the weather events that we see for a few days, or even a few weeks, can actually be explained by patterns around the globe. 
<br><br>
The weather we see on a given day is determined by a number of factors, all piecing together in a weather pattern pie. Some of these factors include local circulations, [blocking patterns](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/Traffic-Jams-and-Club-Sandwiches-in-the-Atmosphere-An-Overview-of-Blocking/), and longer term trends. These vary on all timescales from subseasonal to seasonal (S2S), interannual (year-to-year), decadal, and more. Click around to sample different pieces of our weather pattern pie!

<h2>Why The Tropics Matter</h2>

The tropics, particularly the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans, can give us a lot of information about what weather the United States can expect to see in the following weeks. Tropical climate patterns affect the weather thousands of miles away via [teleconnections](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/a-personality-test-for-our-climate-system-the-basis-for-forecasting-in-between/). Teleconnections are global connections between environmental variables, such as sea level pressure or temperature. They usually occur in see-saw or oscillating patterns. For example, a low-pressure area in one region might be related to high pressure in another region thousands of miles away. 
<br><br>
The primary influencer of tropical and midlatitude (30-60 degrees latitude, encompassing most of the U.S.) weather on S2S timescales is the Madden-Julian Oscillation. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a coupling between heating in the middle of the atmosphere and rising air (convection) that starts near the surface and cycles through the top of the atmosphere. 
<br><br>
The center of the MJO contains a strong storm system, which is sandwiched between two sunny, dry systems. This collective unit usually starts up in the Indian Ocean and moves eastward along the equator, often dissipating around the International Dateline several weeks later.  How and why the MJO is important is explained in more detail in [NOAA’s ENSO Blog](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/madden-julian-oscillation-has-been-active-so-far-winter-here-why-it-matters).

Green shading shows below-average OLR (outgoing longwave radiation, or heat energy) values, indicating more clouds and rainfall, and brown shading identifies above-average OLR (drier and clearer skies than normal). The purple contours show the location and strength of the Pacific jet at the 200-hPa level (roughly 38,000 feet at that location). Note the eastward movement of the wet and dry areas. How far the Pacific jet extends past the international dateline also changes with the phase of the MJO.

<br><br>
Disruptions in the tropical atmosphere can affect weather in the United States through waves that travel along the top of the atmosphere. This teleconnection can be thought of as a jet in the bottom of a hot tub causing an upward motion of the water. The water travels to the surface and ripples away, creating waves on the surface of the water. The rippling waves hit the edges of the hot tub and the water sinks, creating a circulation in the hot tub.

<br><sub><i>This hot tub is an analogy for the MJO circulation and teleconnections. The arrows represent atmospheric waves that can travel thousands of miles from their origin (here, the origin is the jet of the hot tub), carrying signals that can affect distant weather patterns.</i></sub>
<br><br>
The same effect is happening in the strong storm at the center of the MJO. The strong convection of the MJO in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans can be thought of as our hot tub jet. The air near the surface is forced to rise up, disrupting the atmosphere enough to create ripples along the top of the atmosphere. These waves can propagate thousands of miles. They carry signals that can change the temperature, rainfall, and other variables in the mid-latitude region, since this is where the air often sinks. These atmospheric waves affect weather in the U.S. despite the original disruption occurring in the tropics days or weeks before! Hot tub party anyone?
<br><br>

<h2>Predicting Teleconnections</h2>

It takes about two weeks for the waves to travel from the tropical oceanic regions to the United States. While we cannot get a definitive picture of what the temperature or rainfall will look like two weeks after a specific MJO event, we can get an idea of whether the temperature or rainfall will be more or less than average. This may seem unsatisfactory, but it can help both government officials and locals stay prepared. For example, warnings can be put into place to reduce reservoir heights if high flooding is expected, or electric companies can be alerted if a cold event is expected and heaters will be in high use. 
<br><br>
Unfortunately, weather in the U.S. associated with ongoing tropical events is not so easy to predict. A primary reason is that not all MJO events are the same. The storm systems vary in speed, strength, location of dissipation, etc. Tracking the MJO is like tracking a school of fish. You can get a general idea of what its path will look like, but there are always outliers who break the pattern and go rogue. 
<br><br>
Furthermore, the MJO only explains a fraction of the weather patterns that we see in the U.S. Exactly what that fraction is also depends on a number of other factors, such as season, local circulations, or even ENSO. Weather and climate predictions need to account for all of these factors and their relative contribution to a particular forecast.  The MJO is just one slice of the pie. The more we can learn about how the MJO slice fits with the rest of the pie, the better we can understand just what the tropics are telling us about next week’s weather.
