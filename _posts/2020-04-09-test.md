<h2>What Can the Tropics Tell Us about Next Week’s Weather?</h2>

What exactly constitutes a weather event? You may have heard of a front coming from the west that will bring severe weather or huge amounts of snow in the next few days. But the weather events that we see for a few days, or even a few weeks, can actually be explained by patterns around the globe. 
<br>
The weather we see on a given day is determined by a number of factors, all piecing together in a weather pattern pie. Some of these factors include local circulations, [blocking patterns](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/Traffic-Jams-and-Club-Sandwiches-in-the-Atmosphere-An-Overview-of-Blocking/), and longer term trends. These vary on all timescales from subseasonal to seasonal (S2S), interannual (year-to-year), decadal, and more.  

<h2>Why The Tropics Matter</h2>

The tropics, particularly the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans, can give us a lot of information about what weather the United States can expect to see in the following weeks. Tropical climate patterns affect the weather thousands of miles away via [teleconnections](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/a-personality-test-for-our-climate-system-the-basis-for-forecasting-in-between/). Teleconnections are global connections between environmental variables, such as sea level pressure or temperature. They usually occur in see-saw or oscillating patterns. For example, a low-pressure area in one region might be related to high pressure in another region thousands of miles away. 
<br>
The primary influencer of tropical and midlatitude (30-60 degrees latitude, encompassing most of the U.S.) weather on S2S timescales is the Madden-Julian Oscillation. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a coupling between heating in the middle of the atmosphere and rising air (convection) that starts near the surface and cycles through the top of the atmosphere. 
<br>
The center of the MJO contains a strong storm system, which is sandwiched between two sunny, dry systems. This collective unit usually starts up in the Indian Ocean and moves eastward along the equator, often dissipating around the International Dateline several weeks later.  How and why the MJO is important is explained in more detail in [NOAA’s ENSO Blog](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/madden-julian-oscillation-has-been-active-so-far-winter-here-why-it-matters).
<br>
Disruptions in the tropical atmosphere can affect weather in the United States through waves that travel along the top of the atmosphere. This teleconnection can be thought of as a jet in the bottom of a hot tub causing an upward motion of the water. The water travels to the surface and ripples away, creating waves on the surface of the water. The rippling waves hit the edges of the hot tub and the water sinks, creating a circulation in the hot tub. 
<br>
The same effect is happening in the strong storm at the center of the MJO. The strong convection of the MJO in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans can be thought of as our hot tub jet. The air near the surface is forced to rise up, disrupting the atmosphere enough to create ripples along the top of the atmosphere. These waves can propagate thousands of miles. They carry signals that can change the temperature, rainfall, and other variables in the mid-latitude region, since this is where the air often sinks. These atmospheric waves affect weather in the U.S. despite the original disruption occurring in the tropics days or weeks before! 

<h2>Predicting Teleconnections</h2>

It takes about two weeks for the waves to travel from the tropical oceanic regions to the United States. While we cannot get a definitive picture of what the temperature or rainfall will look like two weeks after a specific MJO event, we can get an idea of whether the temperature or rainfall will be more or less than average. This may seem unsatisfactory, but it can help both government officials and locals stay prepared. For example, warnings can be put into place to reduce reservoir heights if high flooding is expected, or electric companies can be alerted if a cold event is expected and heaters will be in high use. 
<br>
Unfortunately, weather in the U.S. associated with ongoing tropical events is not so easy to predict. A primary reason is that not all MJO events are the same. The storm systems vary in speed, strength, location of dissipation, etc. Tracking the MJO is like tracking a school of fish. You can get a general idea of what its path will look like, but there are always outliers who break the pattern and go rogue. 
<br>
Furthermore, the MJO only explains a fraction of the weather patterns that we see in the U.S. Exactly what that fraction is also depends on a number of other factors, such as season, local circulations, or even ENSO. Weather and climate predictions need to account for all of these factors and their relative contribution to a particular forecast.  The MJO is just one slice of the pie. The more we can learn about how the MJO slice fits with the rest of the pie, the better we can understand just what the tropics are telling us about next week’s weather. 


‘Will this stubborn weather ever budge?!’ is a phrase you might have grumpily blurted while scraping ice off of your car for the third consecutive freezing morning. Or, perhaps you utter the phrase staring at your struggling lawn after a week of no rain. What is causing these temperature and precipitation extremes? Well, a traffic jam in the atmosphere—a phenomenon known as atmospheric blocking—could be the culprit. 
<br>
<h2>What <i>exactly</i> is atmospheric blocking?</h2>
Atmospheric blocks are patterns in [atmospheric pressure](https://mediaspace.msu.edu/media/High+and+Low+Pressure+SystemsA+Characteristics+%26+Pairing/0_h5k0jz03) that obstruct atmospheric flow for an average of 5-30 days, aka a subseasonal weather event. 
<br><br>
The two most common blocking patterns that form are Dipole and Omega blocks. Dipole blocks are simple, with a high pressure system north and a low pressure system south. Omega blocks are slightly more complicated, with a large high-pressure system in the center and two lows on its southern flanks, resembling the Greek letter omega Ω. You can find these patterns in the mid-to-high latitudes, most commonly over the North Pacific/Alaska, Greenland, and Europe.
<br><br>

<br><sub><i>The two most common types of blocking patterns Omega (left) and Dipole (right). Note how the main flow is altered by the clockwise high pressure systems and counterclockwise low pressure systems. Map source: matplotlib basemap--yes some of us still use basemap.</i></sub>
<br><br>
The ‘blocking’ or traffic jam aspect comes from the fact that these patterns are mostly stationary. They detour the large-scale atmospheric flow from the normal west-to-east path, similar to how road blockages lead to traffic and alternate routes. 
<br><br>
Atmospheric blocks aren’t small bumps in the road, either! They can take up an area nearly 3-5 times the size of the state of Texas (WOW!!). Therefore, they are large and strong enough to cause the jet stream, the main upper-level west-to-east wind belt, to meander far north and south around the block. 
<br><br>
The jet stream acts as a river between large air masses such as polar and tropical, helping steer where weather systems go. When it gets blocked, there’s trouble in the air! 
<br><br>
Still have a mental block? Think of the jet stream as a river of air and blocking a giant rock in its way. 
<br>
<h2>What happens when atmospheric blocks occur?</h2>
When blocks force the jet stream north and south instead of west to east, it gives the opportunity for hot tropical air to move north and cold polar air to move south for an extended period of time. This often results in dangerous heat waves and cold spells. Blocks can also lead to droughts or flooding by diverting moisture from one place to another. 
<br><br>
But wait, there is a catch. It is important to note that just because it’s extremely cold, hot, rainy, or dry does not mean an atmospheric block is to blame. Other patterns and phenomenon also lead to extreme weather. The key to what makes blocking special is how <b>relentless and persistent</b> it is at causing these extremes to occur at large scales.
<br>
<h2>Are we good at forecasting them?</h2>
Not quite. As explained in our [previous post](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/a-personality-test-for-our-climate-system-the-basis-for-forecasting-in-between/), subseasonal forecasting is the ‘pit of despair’ of prediction. Because blocking persists anywhere from 5-30 days, with extreme cases lasting up to 60 days, these atmospheric traffic jams lie between weather and climate, making it difficult to forecast.
<br><br>
What specifically makes blocking difficult to forecast? Not only is it a subseasonal event, but it occurs between different vertical layers of the atmosphere. Since we are stuck in traffic, let’s pull out a snack, a triple-decker club sandwich to be specific. 
<br><br>
The top piece of bread is where the jet stream is (wayyy up high, where jets fly) and the bottom slice is the Earth’s surface. Sandwiched between the top and bottom layers is a third slice where blocking happens -- the middle of the atmosphere.
<br><br>
Let’s talk fillings. Consider sandwich contents (turkey, cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato… :yum:) as an indirect means of communication between the slices of bread. Blocking uses these components to interact with the atmospheric layers (slices) above and below it. In fact, it depends on these interactions to develop and maintain its structure. Capturing chaotic or non-linear components of any system is extremely difficult, adding to the complexity of an atmospheric blocking forecast. 
<br><br>

<br><sub><i>An atmosphere sandwich! Where layers of the atmosphere are slices of bread and the interactions between those layers are the sandwich contents. Blocking is best compared to a triple-decker turkey club due to it interacting with more than one layer. Note: Vegan options available upon request. </i></sub>
<br><br>
At times, we are unable to even predict the base state for blocking to occur. In reality, the atmosphere is working with what is has in stock, and often deviates from an anticipated recipe that forecast models are wired to follow, leading to a forecast bust. Sometimes we predict the slices to be sourdough (wavy jet stream) and it ends up being whole wheat (straight jet stream). Disappointing, I know.

<br><sub><i>Models are programmed to replicate or guess what the atmosphere will be like based on the average 'ingredients' (right), whereas the actual atmosphere does not always follow the same recipe (left).</i></sub>
<br><br>
Luckily, many great minds are chipping away at this block in our forecasting abilities, so that you can better anticipate when there might be traffic or prolonged extremes. We want you to be as prepared as possible—like making-a-triple-decker-club-sandwich-for-afternoon-traffic-the-day-before level of prepared.
