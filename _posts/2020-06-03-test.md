This year is going to be an active season!!! Sure you’ve heard that before, it’s just hyped for the news headlines, right? Well for 2020 there is some truth to these claims. A lot of universities and scientific organizations are publishing predictions for a much above average hurricane season<sup>1,2,3</sup>. But how do they know?
<br><br>
<h2>Hurricanes as Weather</h2>

Before we dive in, let’s learn a bit about hurricanes and what makes them go (or what stops them in their tracks). There are four main conditions that are needed for a hurricane to form: high humidity, high vorticity, high ocean temperatures and low shear (see below). 
<br><br>
Warm ocean waters, often measured by sea surface temperatures or SSTs, help raise the humidity but more importantly provide the fuel source for hurricanes. The temperature difference between the SSTs and the cold upper atmosphere drives a hurricane’s circulation. 
<br><br>
Shear is the difference in winds between upper and lower levels of the atmosphere. If the winds at the top of the atmosphere are blowing much faster than the winds near the surface it can tilt a hurricane or possibly even rip it apart as seen in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xph9W6C-KiM).
<br><br>
Humidity is needed for a hurricane to produce rain, but more than that, it helps drive the circulation of the hurricane by causing pressures to drop and making the cyclone more intense. If dry air wraps into a hurricane it can cause cooling (from evaporation) which creates sinking motion in the center of the storm, weakening it.
<br><br>
Vorticity is a fancy term for the rotation of winds, a measure of spin. For a hurricane to form it obviously helps if the air is already spinning (counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere). In the Atlantic many storms get their initial spin from African easterly waves. These are not ocean waves, but rather atmospheric waves [HKA4] associated with thunderstorms that emerge off the west coast of Africa near Cabo Verde.

<h2>The Seasonal Hurricane Forecast</h2>

Now that we know a bit about what is needed to make a hurricane, we can anticipate how these ingredients might blend together in the coming months. One easy predictor is the SSTs. Water is very dense and usually changes temperature rather slowly. So, by looking at the [ocean temperatures](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tafb/atl_anom.gif) now, we can make a pretty good guess of what they will be during peak hurricane season. Currently the SSTs are warmer than normal, especially in the tropics which is great… if you are a hurricane! The ocean temperatures are actually linked to an event called the North Atlantic oscillation or NAO [link to last blog] which impacts the hurricane season in other ways and can influence whether storms stay out to sea or move towards land.[HKA6] 
<br><br>
Another hint we can find about the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season comes from the El Niño Southern Oscillation or ENSO. ENSO is a measure of SSTs in the tropical East Pacific[HKA7] , but it produces a gigantic circulation pattern that impacts weather all over the globe (to learn more check out the ENSO blog). During El Niño this circulation pattern becomes stronger over the Atlantic causing an increase in shear and notable decrease in hurricanes [see Fig .2]. [HKA10] El Niño is associated with drier, more stable air over the Atlantic which inhibits hurricane activity. Currently, East Pacific SSTs are about average, but a pool of cool water lies just below the surface meaning a La Niña will likely develop hence predictions for more activity.
<br><br>
<h2>A Subseasonal Hurricane Forecast?</h2>

Switching gears, maybe you don’t need to know how active the whole season is going to be. Maybe you just want to know if it is worth booking a hotel in the Carolinas for one week in September, or you’re a snowbird deciding when it’s safe to come down to Florida. For that you want a subseasonal forecast, something that you need to know weeks in advance but requires a bit more precision than the seasonal forecast. Unfortunately, subseasonal forecasts are hard[HKA8] , especially for hurricanes.
<br><br>
However, our friend the Madden-Julian Oscillation or MJO (see last blog) can help us out. Some phases of the MJO produce more hurricane activity, and the MJO phase can be predicted weeks in advance. How does the MJO influence hurricanes? The MJO can reduce shear and may increase humidity. It may also increase the strength of African easterly waves making them more likely to develop into hurricanes. 
<br><br>
Some of my own research has looked at how the MJO may influence subseasonal hurricane activity especially in combination with ENSO.  One interesting result is that the favorable MJO phase changes depending on the ENSO phase. However, research of the MJO is relatively recent and as always, it’s complicated.
<br><br>
<h2>Take Predictions With a Grain of Salt</h2>
 
Regardless of the seasonal or subseasonal prediction it is important to keep in mind that these types of predictions are statistical. These rules work well over many years, but, there are many exceptions. Even in an active season, no one spot is likely to experience a hurricane. But, if you live in an at-risk area always be prepared because it only takes one.



What exactly constitutes a weather event? You may have heard of a front coming from the west that will bring severe weather or huge amounts of snow in the next few days. But the weather events that we see for a few days, or even a few weeks, can actually be explained by patterns around the globe. 
<br><br>
The weather we see on a given day is determined by a number of factors, all piecing together in a weather pattern pie. Some of these factors include local circulations, [blocking patterns](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/Traffic-Jams-and-Club-Sandwiches-in-the-Atmosphere-An-Overview-of-Blocking/), and longer term trends. These vary on all timescales from subseasonal to seasonal (S2S), interannual (year-to-year), decadal, and more. Click around to sample different pieces of our weather pattern pie!

<br><br>

<h2>Why The Tropics Matter</h2>

The tropics, particularly the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans, can give us a lot of information about what weather the United States can expect to see in the following weeks. Tropical climate patterns affect the weather thousands of miles away via [teleconnections](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/a-personality-test-for-our-climate-system-the-basis-for-forecasting-in-between/). Teleconnections are global connections between environmental variables, such as sea level pressure or temperature. They usually occur in see-saw or oscillating patterns. For example, a low-pressure area in one region might be related to high pressure in another region thousands of miles away. 
<br><br>
The primary influencer of tropical and midlatitude (30-60 degrees latitude, encompassing most of the U.S.) weather on S2S timescales is the Madden-Julian Oscillation. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a coupling between heating in the middle of the atmosphere and rising air (convection) that starts near the surface and cycles through the top of the atmosphere. 
<br><br>
The center of the MJO contains a strong storm system, which is sandwiched between two sunny, dry systems. This collective unit usually starts up in the Indian Ocean and moves eastward along the equator, often dissipating around the International Dateline several weeks later.  How and why the MJO is important is explained in more detail in [NOAA’s ENSO Blog](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/madden-julian-oscillation-has-been-active-so-far-winter-here-why-it-matters).

Green shading shows below-average OLR (outgoing longwave radiation, or heat energy) values, indicating more clouds and rainfall, and brown shading identifies above-average OLR (drier and clearer skies than normal). The purple contours show the location and strength of the Pacific jet at the 200-hPa level (roughly 38,000 feet at that location). Note the eastward movement of the wet and dry areas. How far the Pacific jet extends past the international dateline also changes with the phase of the MJO.

<br><br>
Disruptions in the tropical atmosphere can affect weather in the United States through waves that travel along the top of the atmosphere. This teleconnection can be thought of as a jet in the bottom of a hot tub causing an upward motion of the water. The water travels to the surface and ripples away, creating waves on the surface of the water. The rippling waves hit the edges of the hot tub and the water sinks, creating a circulation in the hot tub.
<br><br>

<br><sub><i>This hot tub is an analogy for the MJO circulation and teleconnections. The arrows represent atmospheric waves that can travel thousands of miles from their origin (here, the origin is the jet of the hot tub), carrying signals that can affect distant weather patterns.</i></sub>
<br><br>
The same effect is happening in the strong storm at the center of the MJO. The strong convection of the MJO in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans can be thought of as our hot tub jet. The air near the surface is forced to rise up, disrupting the atmosphere enough to create ripples along the top of the atmosphere. These waves can propagate thousands of miles. They carry signals that can change the temperature, rainfall, and other variables in the mid-latitude region, since this is where the air often sinks. These atmospheric waves affect weather in the U.S. despite the original disruption occurring in the tropics days or weeks before! Hot tub party anyone?
<br><br>

<h2>Predicting Teleconnections</h2>

It takes about two weeks for the waves to travel from the tropical oceanic regions to the United States. While we cannot get a definitive picture of what the temperature or rainfall will look like two weeks after a specific MJO event, we can get an idea of whether the temperature or rainfall will be more or less than average. This may seem unsatisfactory, but it can help both government officials and locals stay prepared. For example, warnings can be put into place to reduce reservoir heights if high flooding is expected, or electric companies can be alerted if a cold event is expected and heaters will be in high use. 
<br><br>
Unfortunately, weather in the U.S. associated with ongoing tropical events is not so easy to predict. A primary reason is that not all MJO events are the same. The storm systems vary in speed, strength, location of dissipation, etc. Tracking the MJO is like tracking a school of fish. You can get a general idea of what its path will look like, but there are always outliers who break the pattern and go rogue. 
<br><br>
Furthermore, the MJO only explains a fraction of the weather patterns that we see in the U.S. Exactly what that fraction is also depends on a number of other factors, such as season, local circulations, or even ENSO. Weather and climate predictions need to account for all of these factors and their relative contribution to a particular forecast.  The MJO is just one slice of the pie. The more we can learn about how the MJO slice fits with the rest of the pie, the better we can understand just what the tropics are telling us about next week’s weather.
