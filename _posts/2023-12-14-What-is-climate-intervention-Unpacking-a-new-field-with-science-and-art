<br><br>
Hello readers! The Seasoned Chaos team kindly gave me the opportunity to write about a series of four videos I helped create with a team of science and artist collaborators. This series  describes research into <i>climate intervention</i>: potential methods to deliberately intervene in the Earth system to counteract climate change. This topic is a bit different than the regularly scheduled programming here–but it’s hopefully still of interest! You can scroll down to the bottom and check out the videos immediately, or read this post for a few more details first.

<h2>The Climate Change Story So Far</h2>

2023 is likely to be the hottest year in recorded history, and may even become the first individual year to [exceed the 1.5˚C above pre-industrial goal](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02995-7) of the international Paris Climate Accords. As climate change has continued, the impacts have become both increasingly obvious and personal to us all. In Colorado, where I currently live, we have seen [record-shattering heat](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41612-021-00202-w) and [wildfires](https://coloradosun.com/2020/11/02/east-troublesome-fire-colorado-tick-tock/); in my coastal North Carolina hometown, sea level rise causes [frequent “sunny-day flooding”](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/04/science/global-warming-increases-nuisance-flooding.html) and turns freshwater [ecosystems into “ghost forests.”](http://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aba136) Almost everyone [can fill in their own experiences](https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/climate-impacts/climate-change-impacts-region_.html) with climate-fueled hazards, and these impacts [disproportionately affect vulnerable populations](http://www.jstor.org/stable/41328876) that have contributed relatively little to climate change. While governments have pledged to reduce the [greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change](https://seasonedchaos.github.io/Heatwaves-Cow-Farts-and-the-Perfect-Beach-Spot-Sorting-Through-the-Science-of-Climate-Change/), [there is still a large gap between these statements and the actions that would be needed](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.abo3378) to avoid dangerous warming and impacts.
<br><br>
<i>Climate mitigation</i> actions that stop the emissions of greenhouse gases remain the most crucial solution to climate change. Examples of mitigation include approaches such as replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy and investing in clean methods of transportation. Still, the slow pace of these transitions, coupled with the prospect of worsening climate change impacts, motivates research into possible methods to deliberately intervene in the Earth system to reduce climate risk. These are collectively known as <i>climate interventions</i>, and include approaches that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere or directly cool the planet. It’s important to be very clear that <b>interventions are not a substitute for climate mitigation!</b> However, these methods could complement mitigation; essentially, climate intervention may be able to “buy time” for more familiar policies and actions to come into effect.

<h2>Stratospheric Aerosol Injection</h2>

One hypothetical intervention under ongoing research is <i>stratospheric aerosol injection</i>, or SAI for short. SAI would involve the emission of reflective aerosol particles into the upper atmosphere to reflect away a small portion of incoming sunlight, thereby cooling the planet. This is similar to natural processes that occur after many volcanic eruptions, [which are known to cool the planet for a few years](https://doi.org/10.1029/1998RG000054). 
<br><br>
Climate interventions such as SAI can sound like science fiction<sup>1</sup>. But SAI was originally proposed by climate scientists [more than 50 years ago](https://doi.org/10.17226/25762), and is now a mainstream area of scientific research. Most advances on this topic have come in the last decade: Scientists study SAI with computer models, in order to not affect the real world, and models capable of reliably simulating the full physics and chemistry relevant to SAI have only recently been developed.

<h2>Our Videos</h2>

To date, there has been relatively little dedicated science communication about SAI. To provide some general information, our team of physical and social scientists primarily located at Colorado State University worked with the Heartwood Visuals studio to create four short (~2-3 minutes) videos providing a brief overview of climate intervention research. Each video is built around topics that our group’s research could directly address<sup>2</sup>. You can check out the series below!
